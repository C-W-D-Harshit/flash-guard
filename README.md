# 🛡️ FlashGuard

**Protect your eyes from sudden bright flashes and eye strain while watching videos.**

FlashGuard is a Chrome extension that automatically detects bright content in videos and dims them in real-time to prevent eye strain, especially when watching in dark environments.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Real-time Brightness Detection** - Analyzes video frames at 30 FPS using advanced algorithms
- **⚡ Instant Flash Protection** - Immediately dims videos when brightness spikes occur
- **🎛️ Customizable Controls** - Adjust brightness trigger sensitivity and dim strength
- **🌐 Universal Support** - Works on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, and all other video sites
- **🎯 Performance Optimized** - Efficient monitoring with no video lag or interruption
- **🎨 Beautiful UI** - Modern dark theme with intuitive controls
- **💾 Sync Settings** - Your preferences sync across all your devices

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Detection**: Continuously monitors video brightness using canvas sampling
2. **Protection**: When brightness exceeds your threshold, applies CSS filter dimming
3. **Recovery**: Smoothly returns to normal when content gets darker
4. **Customization**: Adjust both trigger sensitivity and dim strength to your preference
